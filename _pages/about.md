# About osfanbuff63

## Who am I?

I'm a Minecraft datapack creator primarly. However, I also love contributing to open-source projects, and especially writing documentation! I've also more recent experimented with the world of the Nintendo Wii's homebrew (and have contributed to [wii.guide](https://wii.guide) multiple times).

When I'm not playing Minecraft or contributing to a project, I usually shuffle between playing Nintendo Switch Sports, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and occasionally Cities: Skylines (but my pc explodes when I try to play that game, my GPU is at 97 C without an overclock lol). On Nintendo games, I go by the name `osfanbuff6` (thanks Nintendo lol). Since I don't have Nintendo Switch Online, the only time you'd realisticly see me with that username is if you (still) have a Wii, and have either [RiiConnect24](https://rc24.xyz) and the Check Mii Out Channel (I think), or [Wiimmfi](https://wiimmfi.de/) and Mario Kart Wii. Or I get Switch Online, lol.

Besides being active on [GitHub](https://github.com/osfanbuff63), I am also active on [Planet Minecraft](https://planetminecraft.com/member/osfanbuff63). I'm also a Helper on [Mojira](https://bugs.mojang.com), and contribute to projects in the [mojira org](https://github.com/mojira) on GitHub.

## Favorite programs

I usually use [Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/get-windows-10) as my OS, but would happily use [Ubuntu Linux](https://ubuntu.com/) if I need to!

I'm still using [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com) as my browser, but will use Firefox if I need to. My Chrome extensions can be found [here](chrome-extensions).

I prefer to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) as my text editor when given an option (you can find a list of my most-used extensions [here](vscode-extensions)) - but for short edits will usually open [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) is my photo editor, and since my PC can't really video edit very well, I'm still using the Microsoft Photos editor built into Windows 10.

Someday maybe this should be its own page? Lol
