## VS Code Extensions

As [I've stated before](about#favorite-programs), VS Code is my favorite text editor (and happens to be the editor I'm using right now :P), and its extension support makes it even better. I use around 45 extensions on a usual basis, but I've put together a list of the top 10 that I use a **lot**. Counting down, from 10 to 1:

## Extension list

### 10: [Remote Repositories](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.remote-repositories)

Sorta a wild card, but useful to check out a repo in VS Code without taking up *more disk space*. Lol.

### 9: [GitHub Markdown Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.github-markdown-preview)

Given I use GFM - uh, like every day - this simplifies the process a lot when I'm using emojis like this: :wave:.

### 8: [markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint)

This one is a bit annoying sometimes - given I use HTML inside of Jekyll projects but in Markdown files a lot, but still good to try to comply to standards.

### 7: [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)

Another Microsoft-made extension on this list. I can't live without IntelliSense anymore after using it (you'll see me mention it a lot from here on out), and Python being the coding language I know the most of (besides mcfunction :P), is a good way to keep learning, and to debug too.

### 6: [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)

Arguably, this would have been higher up on the list if I had used it for longer, and I worked on more projects in here that are more joint. Still a must-have I think.

### 5: [language-mcfunction](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=arcensoth.language-mcfunction)

A start to multiple mcfunction-related extensions on this list. Pretty simple extension for syntax highlighting.

### 4: [GitHub Pull Requests and Issues](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github)

This, for me at least, was sorta superseded by the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com), but that's not a VS Code extension (but @cli, when is this happening? Lol), so this is the closest thing. Pretty seamless integration for GitHub issues/PRs.

### 3: [Remote - WSL](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl)

Another developed by Microsoft. I never knew how easy it was to run Linux on Windows, and use VS Code too... your best friend for debugging lol.

### 2: [EditorConfig for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig)

I think this one goes without saying, that .editorconfig is *really* nice, and this extension being no exception. Amazingly, it even has a button to generate one inside of VS Code :D

### 1: [Data-pack Helper Plus/Spyglass](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SPGoding.datapack-language-server)

**MUST HAVE** for datapack-related things. Another instance of IntelliSense being *so good* and **everything you could ever want with datapacks** pretty much. It's currently being rewritten (hence two names), but **still**. If you make datapacks and have VS Code, this is a Must Have for sure!

## Honorable Mentions

There's a few extensions that just didn't quite make the list, but are still worth a shout-out. Here you go:

### [GitHub Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)

I was reluctant to put a theme extension on the main list, so here it is. The dark theme (for my eyes lol) customized with a cyan bottom bar (#002B2B), works perfectly.

### [GitHub Actions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cschleiden.vscode-github-actions)

This is great for debugging actions inside of VS Code. The reason it didn't make it to the chart for me is that since GitHub uses `.yml` files for so many things, half the time my workflow uses the `action` schema instead of the `workflow` schema, which just makes it throw errors everywhere lol. Yes, I know I can change it manually.

### [NBT Viewer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Misodee.vscode-nbt)

This seems like a great compliment to [Spyglass](#1-data-pack-helper-plusspyglass), but unfortunately I just don't have enough experience with this extension to put it on the chart.

If you'd like me to check out your extension in the future, [contact me](contact)!
