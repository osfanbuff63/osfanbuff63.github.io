## Thoughts on Achievements

UPDATE 6-18-2022: Read [this post](/2022/06/18/github-thoughts-correction) for some corrections and my latest thoughts. Still read this first though!

As stated in a few new features GitHub has introduced lately (namely: [achievements](https://github.blog/2022-06-09-introducing-achievements-recognizing-the-many-stages-of-a-developers-coding-journey/)), I thought I'd spend some time to detail my thoughts on the situation. This is one of a series I'll be doing when I have time.

This very controversal feature is a step in the wrong direction, and then back. For example, the `YOLO` achievement (merge a PR unreviewed), is next to useless, and encourages bad ideas for open-source projects. It's also pretty easy to see that people would try to farm them, meaning worse contributions all-around. Overall, this seems like GitHub trying to encourage contributions (note: which is not bad at all!), but in a way that encourages *bad* contributions instead of good ones, which is simply annoying to project developers, rather than helpful.

My suggestion is that GitHub can 1) Remove the YOLO advancement (as detailed above), 2) Make it so that achievements aren't farmable, and 3) Disable viewing of them by default. #2 meaning that GitHub would make it so that *potentially* you wouldn't be able to get achievements more than once, which sort of solves the farming problem, and #3 meaning that you would have to opt-in to achievements.

There's a lot that could be done here, and it hasn't been done right quite yet - but I still think that it could be redone better.
