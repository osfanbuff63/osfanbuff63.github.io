## Corrections and more food for thought

If you haven't read my [original thoughts](/2022/06/15/github-thoughts), I highly recommend it before reading this post.

So @Livedollar brought up on the [feedback discussion](https://github.com/orgs/github-community/discussions/18153#discussioncomment-2974715) that the achievements more than likely will actually won't bring *as* much bad, since you'll get it by following the GitHub tutorial for a PR. Personally, this makes me take back my thought that they should remove the `YOLO` advancement, so it brings me down to one major point:

- Make advancements only achievable once

This is potentially controversal, but I think that takes care of the farming problem *perfectly*. You see, if you make it so that you only get an advancement once - in the case of YOLO, via the GitHub tutorial - and that reduces the spam problem.

I'd be very interested to hear thoughts on this.
