## Hello World!

This is my new site, for various things. It's still in alpha state, but works at least :P

Thanks for all these people for making cool stuff:

- Jekyll's developers - for Jekyll
- GitHub for GitHub Pages
- All the people who I use actions from
- RiiConnect24 for getting me into Jekyll in the first place
- YOU! For reading this post!

There's much more to come, stay tuned!
